                Rather than writing about a specific outgroup, 
                I think it&rsquo;s more useful to look at how the internet in general has influenced outgroups in general. 
                There will always be people who have niche interests and hobbies that they identify with. 
                These hobbies might prove to be (and usually are) integral to how a person perceives themselves. 
                Take gaming culture or anime culture as an example, both groups have historically been looked down upon as being &ldquo;geeky&rdquo; or &ldquo;nerdy&rdquo;. 
                Through the internet people that were interested in this topic found a place for themselves, a place that does not represent a geographical location, but a place of the mind. 
                From the user layer to the Earth layer they found people who shared their interests, and with time, as these groups got bigger, &ldquo;nerd&rdquo; and &ldquo;geek&rdquo; went from derogatory terms to a title of pride. 
                Through finding a group they belonged to over the internet, these people established new identities for themselves that they could be proud of. 
                And this is not an isolated case. Be it music taste, dressing style, sexual preference, or whatever other interest individuals hold, the internet allowed them to find a place they could be themselves.
