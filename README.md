# About Me
I'm Filip, living wherever I am studying at the time. I call Macedonia (now North Macedonia) home. Currently an NYUAD student I enjoy dying in the sun, taking long walks on the 52 degrees Celcius beach and hiking through the desert. I joke. I jest. I have a lot of hobbies, including gaming, reading, dancing, event management, and anything else that sounds fun (pretty much everything). 

I mainly spend my time in University working and playing around with different types of technology. I have a newfound interest in CTF competitions and have participated in quite a number in the past few months.
