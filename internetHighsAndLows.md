#Articles
The reason for the misuse of the application in the articles is mostly due to the power of anonymity that the internet provides. The easiest way to rid the possibility of such things happening would be to create a hard connection between each internet persona and it’s owner. Of course, the problems with this are numerous, the most obvious one being the loss of privacy of users. In general the ability to not face repercussions for ones online deeds is one of the biggest draws of the internet, and the balance between the Internet's ability to provide such circumstances and it’s security is a hard one to keep.
#Positive Impact
The most obvious positive aspect of the internet would be the ability to instantly connect people. This proves to be extremely convenient in both personal and professional life.
Another of the positives would be the Internet's entertainment value, the ability to instantly fill up the dull moments of life, be it through texting, reading, videos or memes.
Perhaps the most important benefit of the internet is it’s power to educate. For the first time in human history we have at our fingerprints the complete knowledge that humanity has managed to attain.  
#Negative Impact
The most obvious negative aspect of the internet would be the ability to instantly connect people. This proves to be too convenient, as it allows anyone to contact you, and also creates an expectation that you will reply to said contact in a prompt(ish) manner.
Another of the negatives would be the Internet’s entertainment value. Due to it’s entertaining nature the internet serves as a perfect distraction from comparatively mundane activities which can prove to be more productve.
Another negative would be the overwhelming amount of information found on the internet. This overabundance of information easily overwhelms an individual, leaving him with no idea of where to start digesting the information.
#End
Social media creates a negativity circle, which causes a negative emotional state and brings about an abundance of behavioral disorders. An example would be scrolling through Facebook during a study break, only to see friends having fun, perhaps at a pool party, making you feel as though you’re missing out on the fun they’re having. Meanwhile they are at the pool party spending times on their phone instead of enjoying the experience.
